## ✅ What I'm Practicing  
- ✅ Cypress installation and setup
- ✅ Writing first test cases (visit URL, assert title, interact with UI)
- ✅ Working with locators (CSS, XPath)
- ⏳ Validating forms, error messages
- ⏳ Network stubbing & intercepting APIs
- ⏳ Page Object Model (POM)
- ⏳ Fixtures and test data
- ⏳ Reusable custom commands
- ⏳ CI integration (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Cypress
- Mocha + Chai (Assertions)
- GitHub
- [Optional] CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins

## 🧠 Notes
- Each test is tied to a course chapter or topic.
